## Tech Stack:

- Vuejs: I used Vuejs framework to build the user interface. Vuejs system is built around the concept of components and views, components are reusable parts of UI and Code, while views are usually the SPA "pages" that use these components.

- Vuex: Vuex is a state management pattern/library that centralizes the business logic and will unify the source of truth which is the Store.

- SASS

## Testing:
- Unit Testing:
  - Mocha and Chai were used for unit testing
  - Tests cover mutations, getters, actions and vue components
  - Run tests: npm run test:unit
